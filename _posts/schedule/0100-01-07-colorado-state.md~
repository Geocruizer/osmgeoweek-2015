The Geospatial Centroid at Colorado State University is hosting a GIS Day celebration that will involve students, faculty, and business professionals in a variety of GIS related events. The GIS Day celebration will take place on November 18th, 2015 from 9:00 am - 5:00 pm in the Morgan Library Event Hall at CSU. Included in the event will be a poster area to exhibit GIS and Remote Sensing related research being conducted at CSU, Lunch Table Hosts to connect students with practitioners in the field, and a group Map-A-Thon event. The Map-A-Thon will use OpenStreetMap to map priority areas in Senegal and will potentially involve other universities in Colorado to host their own mapping events.
