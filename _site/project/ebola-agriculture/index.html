    <h2>Mapping farmland in Ebola affected areas of West Africa</h2>



<h1 style="color:red">Please note, this is a difficult task, and most suitable for very experienced OSM contributors. </h1>


<p>Identification and mapping of farmlands and orchards in the countries
affected by the recent Ebola virus outbreak</p>

<p>The recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has caused major
disruptions to the food production systems in Liberia, Sierra Leone and
Guinea. Humanitarian organizations are forecasting the potential that
millions of people will be threatened with food insecurity due to both a
shortage of food and increased prices for the food that is available.</p>

<p>This project will map agricultural land use in the affected countries to
help provide aid agencies with needed data for planning, coordination,
mitigation and long term recovery efforts.</p>

Potential Tasking Manager Project Entries
-----------------------------------------

Name of Project:
Identification of Agricultural Land in 2014 Ebola Outbreak Affected 
Countries

Short Description:
* *Priority*: **High**

With the dramatic impact of Ebola in West Africa, food security has the 
potential to become a significant issue in areas hardest hit by the 2014 
outbreak. This project will identify and map areas that are under 
cultivation in the affected countries.

Description:
Agriculture is the main economic activity in West Africa with two thirds 
of the population dependent on farming. The ongoing Ebola outbreak in 
West Africa is causing both immediate food security issues with 
quarantines and travel restrictions and is creating the potential for 
medium term food security issues as people who once worked farms have 
killed by the outbreak or left their farms out of worries about 
contracting the virus.

United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Hilal Elver said 
in November 2014: "Farmers in West Africa have been severely affected by 
this crisis, with fear and panic resulting in many having abandoned 
their farms, this in turn has led to a disruption in food production and 
a soaring rise in food prices. Staple crops such as rice and maize will 
reportedly be scaled back due to shortages in farm labour with potential 
catastrophic effect on food security."

Aid agencies and humanitarian groups are already considering ways to 
deal with these food security issues and the information mapped in this 
project will greatly contribute to their planning and food resource 
coordination efforts.

Entities to map:
Any area clearly under cultivation such as row crops, paddies or orchards

Changeset Comment:
#OSMGeoWeek Ebola Agricultural Mapping Project Task-###

Detailed Instructions:
Using the available satellite imagery please look for agricultural 
landuse areas that have not been mapped yet. From aerial imagery row 
crops should be somewhat obvious with large regularly shaped fields, 
although often they are in small areas with irregular boundaries.

Orchards are also somewhat obvious with neat, regular rows of well 
spaced trees, again, the boundaries of the area may be somewhat irregular.

Please carefully outline farmlands and use the tag: **landuse=farmland**

For iD web editor uses, please do not use the presets of "farm" or 
"farmyard." The following instructions are for the iD web editor:

1. Using the area tool, outline the area of farmland.
2. From the list of presets on the left scroll to the bottom and select 
"Area" preset. This will show you the iD tag editor.
3. Click on the "All Tags (1)" link and it will show you the interface 
to add tags.
4. Click the black " + " tab at the bottom of the tag list
5. Enter "landuse" as the label and "farmland" as the value.

After you outline another area, the "Area" preset will be at the top, 
but you will still need to add the landuse=farmland tag.
